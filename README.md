# owlbot

owlbot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

### Running owlbot Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the environment variables they rely
upon have been set.

You can start owlbot locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    owlbot>

Then you can interact with owlbot by typing `owlbot help`.

    owlbot> owlbot help
    owlbot animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    owlbot help - Displays all of the help commands that owlbot knows about.
    ...

More Functionality coming soon...
